# OCR Segmentation

## Description
This project focuses on segmenting text regions from images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The goal is to preprocess images and extract individual characters or words, which can then be fed into an OCR engine for text recognition.

## Features
- Image preprocessing techniques for improving OCR accuracy.
- Text region detection using bounding boxes or masks.
- Segmentation of text regions into individual characters or words.
- Integration with OCR engines for text recognition.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/ocr-segmentation.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Place your images in the `images/` directory.
2. Run the segmentation script:
   ```bash
   python segment.py
   ```
3. The segmented images will be saved in the `output/` directory.

## Example
Input Image:
![Input Image](images/input_image.jpg)

Output Segmented Characters:
![Segmented Characters](output/segmented_characters.jpg)

## Contributing
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your_feature`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your_feature`).
5. Create a new pull request.
